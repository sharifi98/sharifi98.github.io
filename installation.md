This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing the necessary tools to set up a Flask web application using SQLite as the database.
Prerequisites

    A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
    An internet connection

Step 1: Install VS Code

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, open-source code editor. You can download it from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Alternatively, you can install it using a package manager like Homebrew (macOS) or apt-get (Linux).
Step 5: Clone the repository

Clone the repository containing the Flask application to your local machine using Git. Open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

Replace your-username and your-repository with your own GitHub username and repository name.
